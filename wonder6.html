                        One of the major tourist attractions of Rome, the Colosseum is indeed one of the iconic 7 wonders of the world.
Constructed mainly of sand and concrete, Colosseum is the largest surviving amphitheatre in the world. Built during
the time between 70 AD to 72 AD by the famous Emperor Vespasian, Colosseum is much famed as the Flavian
Amphitheatre that continues to charm the travellers today.<br>
The Colosseum, also named the Flavian Amphitheater, is a large amphitheater in Rome. It was built during the reign of the Flavian emperors as a gift to the Roman people. Construction of the Colosseum began sometime between A.D. 70 and 72 under the emperor Vespasian.
<br>
As one of the few mostly intact structures from the Roman Empire, the Colosseum stands today as a monument to ancient Rome's architectural and engineering prowess. It is also a major source of tourism revenue for the Italian government.
The Colosseum is generally regarded by Christians as a site of the martyrdom of large numbers of believers during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, as evidenced by Church history and tradition. On the other hand, other scholars believe that the majority of martyrdoms may have occurred at other venues within the city of Rome, rather than at the Colosseum, citing a lack of still-intact physical evidence or historical records. These scholars assert that "some Christians were executed as common criminals in the Colosseum—their crime being refusal to reverence the Roman gods", but most Christian martyrs of the early Church were executed for their faith at the Circus Maximus. According to Irenaeus (died about 202), Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions in Rome around 107 A.D and although Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum, tradition ascribes it to that place.
