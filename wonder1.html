                        The <b>Taj Mahal</b> is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of <i>Indo-Islamic architecture.</i> Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperor’s love wrought in living stones.<br>
Built by the famous <i>Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan</i> for its favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, the iconic structure of TajMahal, is the pride of India and more importantly, an epitome of love. Built as early as in the 16th century, TajMahal is the crown of India which is constructed purely of ivory-white marble and is best witnessed during sunrise.<br>
<p>It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD.<br>
The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblong massive prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of the portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia and the arches bordered with rope molding.</p>
