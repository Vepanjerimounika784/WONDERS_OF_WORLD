                        Stunning as it looks, Great Wall of China is one of the those 7 wonders of the world that need no introduction.
Encompassing of defensive fortifications that are a perfect blend of bricks, rammed earth, wood, stones, and other substances, the Great Wall of China was built to protect the Chinese region from invasions of empires during
7th century BC.<br>
he Great Wall of China became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 1987. The wall is the longest man made structure in the world, with a total length of about 13170.7 mi or 21196.18 km. Made over the course of hundreds of years, the wall was built by over 6 different Chinese dynasties, and is over 2,300 years old.
Around 220 B.C.E., <b>Qin Shi Huang</b>, also called the First Emperor, united China. He masterminded the process of uniting the existing walls into one. At that time, rammed earth and wood made up most of the wall.The Great Wall of China was built as a military defensive line to defend the invasions from some northern nomadic nations. Apart from the function of defense, the wall also boosted the economy, as well as promoted the culture exchange and national integration of different nations at its two sides.
