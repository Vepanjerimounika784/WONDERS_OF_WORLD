                        Of all the ancient seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the one and only wonder that has survived to stand tall through thick and thin. Constructed between the period of 2584 BC & 2561 BC, it is the
largest of all three pyramids with a base of about 230.4 metres, and a height of 146.5 metres.<br>
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the <b>largest Egyptian pyramid</b> and the tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh <emp>Khufu</emp>. Built in the early 26th century BC during a period of around <i>27 years</i>, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.<br>
Although many theories persist as to the purpose of the pyramid, the most widely accepted understanding is that it was constructed as a tomb for king KHUFU.
